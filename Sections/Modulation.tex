This section describes the modulation process, it means the action definition involving the emotional state of the agent. \todo[inline]{it is missing the explanation of the action module}
\todo[inline]{I don't think that it is important to describe how works each module of this sub-system. I think that it is enough just to explain the general idea.}
Describe the process of action descomposition(Action Decision) in which the simple actions are defined and executed(possibly in parallel).

Describe the modulation component, how the emotional and relational model modifies the parameters of simple actions.

Finally, describe the action generation component.
