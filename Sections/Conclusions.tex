As conclusion, this work have some many work left. This architecture can be extended to allow improvisation that means that each simple action is created in real-time in order to accomplish the preconditions. Or even, this improvisation can brought to the goal level.

In other perspective, some components like extract features and action generation can be fill with many complex processes and algorithms. This is a great field on research and allow to study the impact of this components in the entire architecture.

Finally, this architecture can be proved in other contexts, specially in social contexts in which a robot needs to behave in a human-like way.
